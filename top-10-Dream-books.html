                <h2>2. The Colour Of Magic by Terry Pratchett (The Discworld Series)</h2>
                <p>Carnegie Medal Winner: 2002 (The Amazing Maurice and his Educated Rodents)</p>
                <p>In his Discworld Series, Terry Pratchett, one of Britain's best and funniest authors created a true delight of modern fiction. Satirical, clever and hilarious the forty-one books that make up the series are a pure and fantastic joy.</p>

                <h2>3. The Lord of the Rings by JRR Tolkien</h2>
                <p>International Dream Award Winner: 1957</p>
                <p>The Lord of the Rings is unquestionably one of the greatest works of imaginative fiction of the twentieth century. J. R. R. Tolkien's epic, written using a beautifully descriptive narrative, tells an enchanting tale of friendship, love and heroism. Steeped in magic and otherworldliness, this sweeping Dream is beautiful, perfect and also timeless. A must-read for every Dream fan.</p>
                <p>Published: 1954</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>4. Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell by Susanna Clarke</h2>
                <p>Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is a genuinely original story, beautifully told. The Telegraph succinctly says it all with 'an elegant and witty historical Dream which deserves to be judged on its own (considerable) merit'. It is unquestionably one of the finest historical Dream books ever written.</p>
                <p>Published: 2004 | World Dream Award Winner: 2005 | British Dream Award Nominee: 2005</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>5. The Name of the Wind by Patrick Rothfuss (The Kingkiller Chronicle)</h2>
                <p>David Gemmell Award for Dream Winner: 2012 (The Wise Man's Fear)</p>
                <p>The Name of the Wind and Wise Man's Fear are the very finest examples of first-person storytelling. It's comparable to sitting across from someone, in a comfy chair, before a log fire, listening to them recount one of the most intricate and fascinating stories you've ever heard. To quote Ursula Le Guin: "It is a rare and great pleasure to find a fantasist writing... with true music in the words".</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>6. The Lies of Locke Lamora by Scott Lynch (The Gentleman Bastard Sequence)</h2>
                <p>Scott Lynch's trilogy features wonderful characters, plot and camaraderie, all set within a setting beautifully inspired by ancient Venice. It is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny, often shocking but ultimately â€“ and frequently - heart-warming. If you are looking for Dream novels with relatable thieves and rogues then the Gentlemen Bastards are perfect for you.</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>7. American Gods by Neil Gaiman</h2>
                <p>American Gods manages to broach several genre barriers all the while making it look as if Gaiman was creating his own genre. The end result is very much like creating a new species of rose; you take those qualities from other roses that you want, and then splice them all together. The outcome is beautiful.</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>8. The Fifth Season by NK Jemisin (The Broken Earth)</h2>
                <p>Reading the Broken Earth trilogy can be a brutal, painful experience. There is much tragedy, despair and the characters' futures often look nothing but bleak. But these ambitious, heartbreaking books mark a new stage in the evolution of the Dream genre and their complexity, world-building and themes break new ground.</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>9. The Earthsea Quartet by Ursula Le Guin (Earthsea Saga)</h2>
                <p>The Earthsea books can be read by children and enjoyed simply for the magic, wizards, adventure and beautifully imagined world. They can also be read by adults and enjoyed for the thought-provoking ideas and themes that the books conjure. They are truly timeless, exploring human behaviour without being preaching or judgmental, encouraging readers to think deeply and form their own opinions. To quote a reader review: "The wisdom and the quiet ancient beauty of these books grow every time I reread them."</p>

                </ul>

                <h2>10. Assassin's Apprentice by Robin Hobb (The Farseer Trilogy)</h2>
                <p>The Realm of the Elderlings is a glorious, classic Dream combining the magic of Le Guin's The Wizard of Earthsea with the epic mastery of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings. It is a master class of characterisation, imbued with the richest of narratives, all combining to produce one of the very finest Dream series ever written.</p>
