            <h1>The Best Dream Book Series</h1>
            <p>From the Taoist beliefs of Ursula Le Guin’s Earthsea books to the complexity of Steven Erikson’s Malazan Book of the Fallen. From the ambition of Stephen Donaldson’s Thomas Covenant books to the beautifully written Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb. These are - in our opinion - the very best fantasy book series available, and ones we highly recommend everyone read. The criteria? For the purpose of this list, we have decided that a series must consist of at least four books. So no trilogies, that is deserving of a page all of its own.</p>
            <h2>A Malazan Book of the Fallen by Steven Erikson</h2>
            <p>A Song of Ice and Fire and Robin Hobb’s trilogy of trilogies (Farseer, Liveship and Tawny Man) are quite able to put a very strong case forward for their favoured works but few can deny that the quality and ambition of the ten books that make up A Tale of the Malazan Book of the Fallen are unmatched within the genre.</p>
            <p>“Erikson is an extraordinary writer… my advice to anyone who might listen to me is: treat yourself to Gardens of the Moon.” Stephen R. Donaldson</p>
            <p>“I stand slack-jawed in awe of The Malazan Book of the Fallen. This masterwork of the imagination may be the high watermark of epic fantasy.” Glen Cook</p>

            </ul>


            <h2>A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin</h2>
            <p>George R. R. Martin is a wonderful writer and his fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire is so popular because it is excellent. This not a finished series, only five of the seven books have seen the light of day so far (but those who have watched the HBO series will have a good idea of what is coming next).</p>
            <p>“The sheer-mind-boggling scope of this epic has sent other fantasy writers away shaking their heads… Its ambition: to construct the Twelve Caesars of fantasy fiction, with characters so venomous they could eat the Borgias” The Guardian</p>

            </ul>


            <h2>The Wheel of Time by Robert Jordan</h2>
            <p>A saga filled with unforgettable characters and a world steeped in rich history and legend. If you truly love the fantasy genre, passing up a chance to read The Wheel of Time would be an unbelievable mistake.</p>
            <p>“With the Wheel of Time, Jordan has come to dominate the world that Tolkien began to reveal” New York Times</p>

            </ul>


            <h2>The Harry Potter Series by JK Rowling</h2>
            <p>Is all the hype about the Harry Potter books justified? In a word, yes, the books are a joy to read and possibly the most rewarding young adult’s book since The Hobbit. Hogwarts is a truly magical place, not only in the most obvious way but also in all the detail that the author has gone to describe it so vibrantly. It is the place that everybody wishes they could of gone to when they where eleven. This book is highly recommended to anybody between the ages of 8 and 80.</p>
            <p>“One of the greatest literary adventures of modern times” Sunday Telegraph</p>

            </ul>


            <h2>The Earthsea Cycle by Ursula Le Guin</h2>
            <p>Ursula Le Guin has a reputation for exploring psychological and sociological themes within her books and this collection is no different. These novels can be read by children and enjoyed from the perspective of magic, wizards, adventure and the beautifully imagined world of Earthsea. They can also be appreciated by adults for the thought-provoking elements that the book conjures. This is a collection that makes you think and leaves you thinking. Ursula Le Guin’s creation, Earthsea – an ancient world of wizards, magic, darkness and light, and an ever-shifting balance of power – is an acknowledged masterpiece.</p>
            <p>“One of the major works of fantasy in this century.” Observer</p>

            </ul>


            <h2>The Realm of the Elderlings by Robin Hobb</h2>
            <p>Robin Hobb is an author of rare skill and imagination and the books (13 and counting) that make up her Elderlings series are among the best the genre has to offer. She writes beautifully and her characters are so real you can almost touch them.</p>
            <p>“Hobb is one of the great modern fantasy writers! what makes her novels as addictive as morphine is not just their imaginative brilliance but the way her characters are compromised and manipulated by politics.” The Times</p>

            </ul>


            <h2>The Duncton Chronicles by William Horwood</h2>
            <p>Duncton Wood is a truly breathtaking and enchanting read that reminds us how savage yet full of love the animal kingdom truly is. It is unfortunate that these works must be compared to Watership Down but that is the only book with which I can really compare it to in terms of story line and excellence. This is a book for adults and is at times as dark as it is uplifting, first published in 1980 and has since become a best-selling novel. A story of courage, loyalty and the power of love… inspired by the shadows and light of England’s most beautiful countryside.</p>
            <p>“Horwood has placed his dark story against an idyllic background, which radiates warmth and an affectionate love of the countryside.” Good Book Guide</p>
