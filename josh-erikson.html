            <h1>An interview with Josh Erikson</h1>
            <div class="margin-auto">
              <p><strong>What are you currently reading Josh?</strong></p>
              <p>I&rsquo;m about ten pages into Senlin Ascends by Josiah Bancroft. Pretty much everyone I know in the industry keeps gushing about this series, so I figured it was time to go ahead and fall in love with it already.</p>
              <p><strong>Your first novel, Hero Forged, is set mostly in Lincoln, Nebraska. That&#39;s not a common setting for urban fantasy. What inspired you to set it there?</strong></p>
              <p>I use &ldquo;urban&rdquo; a little loosely here, but I live in a town of 13,000 people, so anywhere with more than one McDonald's is a sprawling metropolis to me. I picked Lincoln in particular for two reasons:</p>
              <p>First, I know the place. It&rsquo;s near where I live, so I knew I could ensure plenty of verisimilitude in my setting. And if a few locals buy my book purely out of curiosity, that&rsquo;s a bonus!</p>
              <p>Second, I really like poking fun at the tropes and stereotypes in fantasy fiction. That&rsquo;s at least 30% of my jokes. So setting an &ldquo;urban&rdquo; fantasy in Nebraska was really the first volley after the title itself.</p>
              <p><strong>Your books are known for witty dialog. Does creating that dialog come naturally for you right away or is it something that is crafted through the revision process?</strong></p>
              <p>It&rsquo;s how I talk in real life. I grew up on Joss Whedon&rsquo;s stuff, and I&rsquo;m lucky enough to be surrounded by people who challenge me to keep up intellectually in conversations. So all that turned into a proclivity for snappy banter...often to gloss over the fact that I have no idea what I&rsquo;m talking about. The other, more clinical reason is that I have a pretty hard time letting loose, so dry humor has always been my work-around to approximate being a fun person.</p>
              <p><strong>The main character in Hero Forged and Fate Lashed, Gabe, reminds me in some ways of Nate Ford in Leverage. What inspired Gabe&#39;s character, either from fiction or real life?</strong></p>
              <p>I love Leverage! And Nate Ford is an awesome example. But I also took a little influence from characters like Vash from the anime Trigun and Wash from Firefly. Then I added a healthy dose of the kind of self-doubt we all deal with. A self-deprecating conman just sounded fun to me. Gabe is pretty competent when he can be bothered to try, but all of his confidence is self-made and built on some shaky foundations. He has to be pushed hard to get anywhere near his potential, which is why he works so well with Heather...&nbsp;</p>
              <p><strong>Who would run the better con, Gabe or Mat from the Wheel of Time?</strong></p>
              <p>That&rsquo;s a tough one. I think Gabe does it more intuitively and works better one-on-one. He can&nbsp; take one quick look at someone and figure out how to get through their defenses. But he&rsquo;s also aware of his limitations&mdash;to a fault, really.</p>
              <p>Mat is more of a gambler and trickster, using pure confidence and wits to convince people to do ridiculous stuff. And while he works well at a much bigger scale, he doesn&rsquo;t always know when to stop.</p>
              <p>So if we&rsquo;re trying to con a college kid into adding the &ldquo;supplemental hot-plate coverage&rdquo; on some fictitious dorm room insurance, I&rsquo;d pick Gabe. But if we&rsquo;re trying to con the Dark One into believing we have an army of purple bedazzled steam mechs, Mat definitely has the edge. (I haven&rsquo;t finished Wheel of Time yet, so I can only assume this is how it ends.)</p>
              <p><strong>For the various Umbra in your books, you draw from a wide range of folklore and cultures. What has been the most difficult umbra/umbra type to research?</strong></p>
              <p>The super-secret sauce to this series is that the Umbras readily evolve from their origins as two-dimensional archetypes. So when I do research, it&rsquo;s just a starting point for developing the deeper characters they&rsquo;ve become/are becoming. But, Aka Manah was definitely the most challenging to dig into. He comes from Zoroastrianism as a spirit of evil thought, but he&rsquo;s used to cover a wide range of bad stuff that we might otherwise chalk up to the darker sides of human nature. And it&rsquo;s not always clear who he is in that mythos as it&rsquo;s changed through the centuries. It&rsquo;s fascinating stuff, and as soon as I read about him I knew I wanted him as a part of this story. Little did I know how thoroughly he would worm his way in...</p>
              <p><strong>In terms of writing, what comes first for you: character(s), plot, or setting?</strong></p>
              <p>Characters first, last, and always. For me, the plot grows from the characters anyway, and the setting is just a pretty place for them to play. (Unless the setting is basically a character itself, which some books do really well.) I&rsquo;ll outline a little at the start to make sure I don&rsquo;t lose my threads, but ultimately these characters tell me how things go. Sometimes I&rsquo;m just as surprised as you are at what happens. There&rsquo;s even something at the end of Fate Lashed that I really didn&rsquo;t want, but I just couldn&rsquo;t force myself to see it happening any other way. The characters insisted.</p>
              <p>Stephen King calls stories &ldquo;found things&rdquo;, like they already exist out there, and we&rsquo;re just here to unearth and enjoy them. That&rsquo;s how it is for me.</p>
              <p><strong>You narrate your own audiobooks--what do you like most about narrating your own, and are there any frustrations with doing so?</strong></p>
              <p>I LOVE narrating the audio for these books. I start voicing these characters from the first draft, so really all I&rsquo;m doing is polishing that performance for everybody else. And I think my writing style tends to skew toward the audio format anyway. Sometimes a line or character doesn&rsquo;t quite work for people on paper, and I don&rsquo;t understand why. Then I compare the audio version and realize that I&rsquo;d added some tiny trait in the voice that gave it more life. That&rsquo;s harder for me to notice since I almost never read my own stuff silently. It&rsquo;s a tough line to walk. But the reward is that I get to BECOME these characters for the awesome people listening. And that&rsquo;s the coolest thing ever.</p>
              <p>The downside is editing the audio. It&rsquo;s a brutal fusion of technical expertise and artistic intuition that takes me almost as long as writing the first draft itself. Imagine inspecting every inch of a roll of toilet paper and meticulously tweezing out each imperfection...then rolling it back up flawlessly so nobody notices. Now do that for the whole pack. It&rsquo;s like that...only in the classiest possible sense. Like, luxurious quilted four-ply.</p>
              <p><strong>What&#39;s one piece of advice you would give to folks looking to self-publish?</strong></p>
              <p>Do your best possible work. Not just when you want to be done or when you feel pretty good about it, but when it&rsquo;s the best thing you&rsquo;ve ever accomplished. Because you&rsquo;re competing against traditionally published stuff whether you like it or not, and the goal should always be side-by-side judgment against those books. You CAN do it, even if it feels daunting at the start. Work hard, be flexible, be thorough. And learn to take yourself 100% seriously as an artist...while taking yourself 0% seriously as a person.</p>
              <p>That being said...still have fun with it, you know?</p>
              <p><strong>Finally, how can readers find more about you and your work?</strong></p>
